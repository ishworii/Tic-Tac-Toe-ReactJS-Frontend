- npm (v6 or higher)
- Backend server running on port 9000

## Installation

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the board
- First player to get their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw

## API Integration

The game requires a backend server running on port 9000. The API endpoint expects:

```javascript
// POST /findBestMove
{
  "cellSize": number,    // Board size (3, 4, or 5)
  "board": string[]     // Current board state with null for empty cells
}
```

Response format:
```javascript
{
  "bestMove": number    // Index of AI's chosen move
}
```
